## Overview

The Nexis Network Global Hackathon 2025 is a multi-category, global competition where participants build innovative decentralized applications (dApps) on an up‑and‑coming layer‑1 blockchain. This hackathon encourages projects that not only leverage Nexis Network’s native features (like cross‑chain functionality, on‑chain governance, and integrated AI modules) but also drive real on‑chain volume and liquidity.

By addressing key blockchain sectors such as DeFi, NFTs, payments, derivatives, prediction markets, and beyond, your project has the potential to shape the future of decentralized finance and digital ecosystems.
